I'm a final-year Ph.D. student at Oklahoma State University, supervised by [Pro. Glenn Zhang](https://experts.okstate.edu/glenn.zhang). I completed my masterâ€™s degree at Nanjing Argriculture University,under the supervision of [Prof. Weiyun Zhu](https://research.com/u/weiyun-zhu). My doctoral research focuses on developing antibiotic alternatives through microbiome-based approaches. 




Profile of Qualifications
------
* 5 years of experience in bioinformatics and NGS data analysis and visualization, particularly with 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and RNAseq.
* Extensive hands-on experience in animal experimentation, as well as DNA/RNA isolation and characterization.


Research Interests
------
Antibiotic resistance is a serious concern throughout the world, involving the transfer of bacteria and genes between humans, animals and the environment.This has led to a [global ban on antibitoic use in livestock and poutry production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_use_in_livestock#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20antibiotics%20for%20growth%20promotion%20purposes%20was%20banned,January%202017%2C%20through%20regulatory%20change). <img align="right" width="550" salt="figure1" src="https://github.com/jingliu92/jingliu.github.io/assets/100873921/8b0951e2-08d8-4164-9840-aab84153b6f8"> To maintain the sustainability and profitability of livestock and poultry industry, there's an urgent need for developing antibiotic alternatives. Manipulation of the gut microbiome is currently being actively explored as novel antibiotic-alternative approach. Utilizing multi-omics techniques and bioinformatics analysis, my research is dedicated to identifying microbiota or microbial metabolites with the potential to serve as novel antibiotics alternatives. My work is organized into following two main areas: 
* **NGS data analysis pipeline development and refining**: Developed data analysis workflows using Python and R for NGS data analysis, statistical computing, and visualization, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and RNAseq.  

* **Development of antibiotic alternatives through microbiome-based approaches**: Conducted multiple animal trials and microbiome research to identify microbiome or microbial metabolites biomarkers that could be developed as antibiotic alternatives.
