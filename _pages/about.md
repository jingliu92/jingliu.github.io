I'm a final-year Ph.D. student at Oklahoma State University, supervised by [Pro. Glenn Zhang](https://experts.okstate.edu/glenn.zhang). I completed my masterâ€™s degree at Nanjing Argriculture University,under the supervision of [Prof. Weiyun Zhu](https://research.com/u/weiyun-zhu). My doctoral research focuses on developing antibiotic alternatives through microbiome-based approaches.
