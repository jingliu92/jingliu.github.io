## Research Outline
***
Antibiotic resistance is a serious concern throughout the world, involving the transfer of bacteria and genes between humans, animals and the environment. [Many countries have banned the use of antibiotics in livestock animals] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_use_in_livestock#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20antibiotics%20for%20growth%20promotion%20purposes%20was%20banned,January%202017%2C%20through%20regulatory%20change). To maintain the sustainability and profitability of livestock production, there's an urgent need for developing antibiotic alternatives. Manipulation of the gut microbiome is currently being developed as an novel antibiotic-alternative approach.
